- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniele aka @PixelCrafterNinja  
- 👀 I’m into elegant code and snacks I can sneak with style. I shamelessly copy from everywhere—Gemini, GPT, and good old Stack Overflow!  
- 🌱 Currently learning tricks to look busy, especially during meetings that could’ve been emails.  
- 💞️ Seeking partners in crime to epically complain about projects!  
- 📫 How to message me: I reply faster if your text says “I’ll send you 5 euros”, “I’ll buy you a beer”, or if you start with a meme or a gif.  
- 😄 Pronouns: Ninja/Anything as long as it’s not “Danielino.”  
- ⚡ Fun fact: Between commits, pushes, and pulls, my memory’s full of holes; but if you ask me something silly, I’ll answer in a heartbeat.
